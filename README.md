To open the web app, after you have downloaded the required packages from requirements.txt, firstly run the database.py file which will create a compatible database from the imdb csv file.
Then proceed to run the app.py file, you can either open the link given in terminal:"http://127.0.0.1:5000" or simply copy it into your web browser.
If any issues occur regarding the path/to/csv.file, please modify the path within database.py so it suits your setup.
Also a little heads up if have issues "pulling" the files please just copy and paste them into your own
